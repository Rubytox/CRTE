When a template meets the following criteria, it is possible to escalate privileges:

* template has attribute `ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT`,
* template has EKU `Client Authentication`,
* requesting template does not require manager approval.

Users who can request a certificate with this template can impersonate any user of the domain by supplying a custom subject.

Request a certificate:

```powershell
> Certify.exe request /ca:TechcorpDC.techcorp.local\TECHCORP-DC-CA /template:ForAdminsofPrivilegedAccessWorkstations /altname:Administrator
```

For some reason, if you authenticate with [#pkinit-authentication](../../misc/ad-authentication.md#pkinit-authentication "mention") and use `/createnetonly` it doesn't work.
